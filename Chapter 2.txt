The traveler, named Leo, was an art curator from the Gerxia galaxy searching for undiscovered talent. He marveled at Clara’s work and urged her to bring her paintings to his home planet of Tevagox for an exhibition. At first, Clara hesitated. Going to an alien planet was a very big decision. But Leo's passion for her work stirred something within her—a curiosity to see how far her art could reach. With a mixture of excitement and fear, she agreed to travel with him, bringing her best pieces to display in the heart of the capital.
