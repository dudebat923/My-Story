The traveler, named Leo, was an art curator searching for undiscovered talent. He marveled at Clara’s work and urged her to bring her paintings to the city for an exhibition. At first, Clara hesitated. The city was loud and foreign to her, a place she had never ventured. But Leo's passion for her work stirred something within her—a curiosity to see how far her art could reach. With a mixture of excitement and fear, she agreed to travel with him, bringing her best pieces to display in the heart of the city.
